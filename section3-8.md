Reinforcement Learning

1. Environment : The place where agents perform actions and gets state, rewards.
                    The Environment can be anything like real world, game, stock market

2. Agents : The actual AI which will perform actions on Environment and get rewards, based on the rewards it will learn
            buying and selling stocks and getting rewrard
            Rewards are +1, -1 for agents

No pre programmed algorithm inside agent in reinforcement learning

try and error where it will get +1, -1 and learn automatically on its own
